This vulnerability can lead to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.\n\n**Minimal Patch**\n\nHere's a unified diff that removes the hardcoded password:\n```diff\n--- app/main.py\n+++ app/main.py\n@@ -12,7 +12,6 @@\n-def get_password():\n-    return \"my_secret_password\"\n+\n```\n\nThis patch simply removes the `get_password` function and its hardcoded password. The actual implementation of password retrieval should be moved to a secure configuration file or an environment variable.\n\n**Follow-up Tasks**\n\n1. **Testing**: Verify that the removal of the hardcoded password does not break any existing functionality.\n2. **Configuration**: Update the application's configuration to use a secure method for retrieving passwords, such as reading from an environment variable or a secrets manager.\n3. **Code Review**: Perform a thorough code review to identify and remediate any other potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.\n\nBy applying this minimal patch and following up with these tasks, we can significantly reduce the risk of password-related attacks and ensure the overall security of our application.",

This could allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-0001.\n\n**Task 2: Provide a minimal unified diff for the file (if text-based)**\n\nHere's a suggested patch to update the OpenSSL version:\n```\ndiff --git a/Dockerfile b/Dockerfile\nindex 123456..789012 100644\n--- a/Dockerfile\n+++ b/Dockerfile\n@@ -10,7 +10,7 @@ FROM python:3.9-slim\n\n # Update OpenSSL to a secure version (e.g., 1.1.1k)\n-RUN pip install --upgrade pyOpenSSL\n+RUN pip install --upgrade pyOpenSSL==1.1.1k\n```\nThis patch updates the OpenSSL version to a known secure one (1.1.1k). You can adjust this version number based on your specific requirements.\n\n**Task 3: Note any deployment/policy implications**\n\nTo ensure the security of your Docker image, consider the following:\n\n* Update your CI/CD pipeline to use the new, secure OpenSSL version.\n* Review your application's dependencies and libraries to ensure they are also up-to-date and secure.\n* Consider implementing a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., Trivy) as part of your continuous integration and deployment process.\n\nBy making these changes, you'll be able to minimize the risk of exploitation from known vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-0001.",

You should replace `myuser` and `mygroup` with actual values that are appropriate for your use case.\n\nDeployment/policy implications:\n\n* This change will require updating any scripts or tools that rely on the root user in the Dockerfile.\n* You may need to update your CI/CD pipeline to reflect this change, as it may affect how images are built and deployed.\n* Consider implementing a policy to ensure that all new Dockerfiles use non-root users by default.\n\nBy making this change, you'll reduce the attack surface of your containerized applications and improve overall security.",
