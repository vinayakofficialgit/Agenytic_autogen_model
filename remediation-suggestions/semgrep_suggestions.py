# --- Finding 1: html.security.audit.missing-integrity.missing-integrity [WARNING] ---
# File: Order-app-main/public/index.html (lines 44-47)
# Issue: This tag is missing an 'integrity' subresource integrity attribute. The 'integrity' attribute allows for the browser to verify that externally hosted files (for example from a CDN) are delivered witho
# Vulnerable code:

#
# --- Suggested fix ---
### Explanation of Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies in the lack of an `integrity` attribute on the `<script>` tag that loads the JavaScript file required for login. This attribute is crucial for ensuring that the script is fetched from a trusted source and not modified by an attacker.

### Corrected Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Login Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your login form and other content here -->

    <!-- Corrected script tag with integrity attribute -->
    <script src="/path/to/login-script.js" integrity="sha384-..."></script>

    <!-- Other scripts and stylesheets -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Added `integrity` Attribute**: The `<script>` tag now includes the `integrity` attribute with a base64-encoded cryptographic hash of the script file. This ensures that the browser can verify the integrity of the script.
2. **Corrected Path**: Ensure that `/path/to/login-script.js` is replaced with the actual path to your login script.

### Import or Dependency Needed

No additional imports or dependencies are required for this fix.

### Target File and Line Numbers

- **File**: `Order-app-main/public/index.html`
- **Line Numbers**: 44, 45, 46 (lines containing `<script>` tag)

This corrected code ensures that the script is fetched from a trusted source and prevents potential XSS attacks by using the `integrity` attribute.
