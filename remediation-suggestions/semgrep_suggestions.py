**Vulnerability Explanation:**
The vulnerability is missing subresource integrity (SRI) attribute for an externally hosted resource, making it susceptible to manipulation by attackers.

**Corrected Code:**
```html
<!-- Order-app-main/public/index.html (lines 44-47) -->
<script src="https://example.com/script.js" integrity="sha256-<base64-encoded-hash>" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
**File and Line Numbers:**
Replace lines 44-47 in the file `Order-app-main/public/index.html`.

**Note:** You'll need to replace `<base64-encoded-hash>` with the actual base64-encoded hash of the script.js file. You can generate this hash using a tool like OpenSSL or a SRI generator.

**Language:** HTML
