## Finding 54: `CVE-2025-30360` [MEDIUM]

**File:** `package-lock.json`

**Package:** webpack-dev-server (4.11.1 → 5.2.1)

Here are the step-by-step remediation steps:

**Step 1: Update the vulnerable package**

To update the `webpack-dev-server` package, you'll need to run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install webpack-dev-server@latest
```
This will update the package to the latest version (5.2.1) that includes the fix for CVE-2025-30360.

**Step 2: Exact command or file change needed**

After running the above command, you'll need to update your `package-lock.json` file to reflect the new version of `webpack-dev-server`. You can do this by running:
```
npm ls webpack-dev-server
```
This will show you the current version of `webpack-dev-server` installed in your project. Then, you can update the `package-lock.json` file by running:
```
npm install --save-exact webpack-dev-server@5.2.1
```
This command will update the `package-lock.json` file to reflect the new version of `webpack-dev-server`.

**Step 3: Any breaking changes to watch for**

When updating from version 4.11.1 to 5.2.1, you should be aware of the following potential breaking change:

* The default value of the `--inline` flag has changed from `true` to `false`. If your project relies on this flag being enabled by default, you may need to update your configuration files accordingly.

To confirm that the update was successful, you can run:
```
npm ls webpack-dev-server
```
This should show you the updated version of `webpack-dev-server` (5.2.1) installed in your project.

That's it! By following these steps, you should be able to safely remediate the vulnerability and ensure that your project is up-to-date with the latest security fixes.

## Finding 55: `CVE-2023-26115` [MEDIUM]

**File:** `package-lock.json`

**Package:** word-wrap (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)

Here are the step-by-step remediation steps:

**Step 1: Update the vulnerable package**

To update the `word-wrap` package, you'll need to run the following command:
```
npm install word-wrap@1.2.4
```
This will update the package to the fixed version (1.2.4) and install it in your project.

**Step 2: Update the `package-lock.json` file**

After updating the package, you'll need to update the `package-lock.json` file to reflect the new version of the package. You can do this by running:
```
npm ls
```
This will list all the packages installed in your project, including the updated `word-wrap` package. Then, open the `package-lock.json` file and update the version number for the `word-wrap` package to `1.2.4`.

Here's an example of what the updated `package-lock.json` file might look like:
```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "word-wrap": "1.2.4"
  }
}
```
**Step 3: Verify the update**

To verify that the package has been updated correctly, you can run:
```
npm ls word-wrap
```
This should show you the new version of the `word-wrap` package (1.2.4).

**Breaking changes to watch for:**

There are no known breaking changes in this update, so you shouldn't experience any issues with your project after updating the package.

That's it! By following these steps, you've successfully updated the vulnerable `word-wrap` package and fixed the ReDoS vulnerability (CVE-2023-26115).

## Finding 56: `CVE-2024-37890` [HIGH]

**File:** `package-lock.json`

**Package:** ws (7.5.9 → 5.2.4, 6.2.3, 7.5.10, 8.17.1)

Here are the safe and actionable remediation steps:

**Remediation Step 1: Update the Vulnerable Package**

To update the vulnerable `ws` package, you can use npm (Node Package Manager) to upgrade it to a fixed version.

**Command:**
```
npm install ws@latest
```
This command will update the `ws` package to its latest version, which includes the security fixes for CVE-2024-37890.

**Remediation Step 2: Verify the Update**

After updating the package, verify that it has been successfully upgraded by checking the package version:
```
npm ls ws
```
This command will display the installed version of `ws`, which should be one of the fixed versions (5.2.4, 6.2.3, 7.5.10, or 8.17.1).

**Remediation Step 3: Update package-lock.json**

To reflect the updated package version in your project's `package-lock.json` file, run:
```
npm install --package-lock-only
```
This command will update the `package-lock.json` file to include the new version of the `ws` package.

**Breaking Changes to Watch For:**

When updating the `ws` package, be aware that some breaking changes may occur. Specifically:

* The `ws` package has dropped support for Node.js 14 and earlier versions. If you're using an older version of Node.js, you'll need to upgrade to a supported version (Node.js 16 or later) before updating the `ws` package.
* The `ws` package has also changed its default behavior regarding the `maxPayload` option. You may need to update your code to accommodate these changes.

By following these steps and being aware of potential breaking changes, you can safely remediate the vulnerability and ensure your project remains secure.

## Finding 57: `CVE-2024-37890` [HIGH]

**File:** `package-lock.json`

**Package:** ws (8.11.0 → 5.2.4, 6.2.3, 7.5.10, 8.17.1)

Here are the safe and actionable remediation steps:

**Step 1: Update the vulnerable package**

To update the `ws` package, you'll need to run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install ws@latest
```
This command will upgrade the `ws` package to the latest version that includes the fix for CVE-2024-37890.

**Step 2: Exact command or file change needed**

The exact command is:
```
npm install ws@8.17.1
```
This command installs the specific version of `ws` (8.17.1) that fixes the vulnerability, rather than installing the latest version which may introduce breaking changes.

**Step 3: Any breaking changes to watch for**

When updating the `ws` package, you should be aware of the following potential breaking changes:

* If you're using a custom WebSocket implementation or have modified the `ws` package in some way, upgrading to a newer version might break your code.
* The `ws` package has undergone significant changes between versions 5.2.4 and 8.11.0 (the range of fixed versions mentioned in the vulnerability report). You should review any custom code or integrations you have with the `ws` package to ensure they remain compatible.

**Additional steps**

To confirm that the update was successful, you can check the version of the `ws` package installed on your system:
```
npm ls ws
```
This command will display the installed version of `ws`, which should now be 8.17.1 or higher.

It's also a good idea to run a Trivy scan again after updating the package to ensure that the vulnerability is no longer present:
```
trivy fs --exit-zero
```
This command will re-scan your filesystem for vulnerabilities and report any new findings.
