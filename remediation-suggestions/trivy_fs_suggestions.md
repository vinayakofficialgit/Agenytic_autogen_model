## Finding 14: `CVE-2024-33883` [MEDIUM]

**File:** `package-lock.json`

**Package:** ejs (3.1.8 → 3.1.10)

Certainly! Here are the steps to remediate the Trivy filesystem vulnerability in your project:

### Step 1: Update the Vulnerable Package

To update the `ejs` package from version 3.1.8 to 3.1.10, you can use npm or yarn.

#### Using npm:
```sh
npm install ejs@^3.1.10 --save-dev
```

#### Using yarn:
```sh
yarn add ejs@^3.1.10 --dev
```

### Step 2: The Exact Command or File Change Needed

After running the update command, you will need to manually check your `package-lock.json` file to ensure that the new version of `ejs` is installed correctly.

#### Example of a `package-lock.json` change:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ejs": "^3.1.10"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Any Breaking Changes to Watch for

After updating the package, you should watch for any breaking changes in the new version of `ejs`. Here are some common breaking changes:

- **Breaking Change**: The `ejs` library now uses ES6 modules by default. If your project is not using ES6 modules, you will need to update your code to use ES6 syntax.
  - Example: Replace `require('ejs')` with `import ejs from 'ejs';`.

**File:** `package-lock.json`

**Package:** react-router (6.4.5 → 6.30.2, 7.9.6)

### Step 1: Update the Vulnerable Package

To address the vulnerability, you need to upgrade the `react-router` package to a version that is not affected by CVE-2025-68470.

#### Steps:
1. **Identify the Latest Version**: Check the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) or use a tool like `npm-check-updates` to find the latest version of `react-router`.

   ```sh
   npm install react-router@latest
   ```

2. **Verify the Upgrade**: After updating, verify that the new version is installed correctly.

   ```sh
   npm list react-router
   ```

### Step 2: The Exact Command or File Change Needed

After updating the package, you need to update the `package-lock.json` file to reflect the new dependency version. This file contains all the dependencies and their versions for your project.

#### Steps:
1. **Update `package-lock.json`:**
   Open the `package-lock.json` file in a text editor.
   Locate the line that specifies the `react-router` package and update it to the latest version.

   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "react-router": "^6.4.5" // Update this to the latest version
   }
   ```

2. **Save the File**: Save the changes to the `package-lock.json` file.

### Step 3: Any Breaking Changes to Watch for

After updating the package, you should watch for any breaking changes that might affect your project. Here are some common breaking changes:

- **Breaking Changes in React Router v6**:
  - The `react-router-dom` package has been renamed to `react-router`.
  - The `useHistory` hook now returns an object with a `push`, `replace`, and `go` method.
  - The `Link` component now uses the `to` prop instead of the `href` prop.

- **Breaking Changes in React Router v7**:
  - The `react-router-dom` package has been renamed to `react-router`.
  - The `useHistory` hook now returns an object with a `push`, `replace`, and `go` method.
  - The `Link` component now uses the `to` prop instead of the `href` prop.

### Additional Steps

- **Test Your Application**: After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure that there are no issues related to the updated package.
- **Document Changes**: Document any changes you made to the `package-lock.json` file and any other relevant files.

By following these steps, you can safely update the vulnerable `react-router` package and mitigate the CVE-2025-68470 vulnerability in your project.

### 3. Watch for Breaking Changes

#### Step-by-Step Command:
```sh
# Check for any breaking changes in the updated package
npm outdated --depth=0
```

#### Explanation:
- `npm outdated` lists all packages that are out of date.
- `--depth=0` ensures that only the top-level package is listed, which helps in verifying if there are any breaking changes.

### 4. Test the Application

#### Step-by-Step Command:
```sh
# Run your application to ensure it works as expected after the update
npm start
```

#### Explanation:
- `npm start` starts your application.

   ```
   [INFO] nodejs-semver: Regular expression denial of service
   ```

4. **Update the Package**:
   Once you have identified the vulnerable package, update it to a version that is not affected by the vulnerability.

   For example, if `nodejs-semver` is currently at version 7.3.8, you can upgrade it to version 7.5.2:

   ```sh
   npm install semver@7.5.2 --save-dev
   ```

   If you are using Yarn, use the following command:

   ```sh
   yarn add semver@7.5.2 --dev
   ```

### 2. The Exact Command or File Change Needed

The exact command to update the package will depend on your project's package manager and the version of `nodejs-semver` you are currently using.

#### Example Commands:

- **npm**:
  ```sh
  npm install semver@7.5.2 --save-dev
  ```

- **Yarn**:
  ```sh
  yarn add semver@7.5.2 --dev
  ```

To address the Trivy filesystem vulnerability CVE-2025-68157, you need to update the `webpack` package to a version that includes the fix for this issue. Here are the steps to follow:

### 1. Update the Vulnerable Package

First, identify the latest version of `webpack` that includes the fix for CVE-2025-68157. You can do this by checking the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) or using a tool like `npm-check-updates`.

For example, if you are using npm, you can update `webpack` to the latest version with:
```sh
npm install webpack@latest --save-dev
```

### 2. The Exact Command or File Change Needed

After updating the package, you need to ensure that the change is reflected in your project's `package-lock.json`. This file contains all the dependencies and their versions. You can update the version of `webpack` directly in this file.

For example, if you are using npm, open the `package-lock.json` file and find the line:
```json
"webpack": "^5.75.0"
```
Change it to:
```json
"webpack": "^5.104.0"
```

### 3. Any Breaking Changes to Watch for

After updating the package, you should watch for any breaking changes that might affect your project. Here are some common issues and their potential solutions:

- **Breaking Changes in `webpack`**: If the new version of `webpack` introduces breaking changes, you may need to update other dependencies or refactor your code accordingly.
- **Configuration Changes**: Some configuration options in `webpack` have changed between versions. Ensure that your webpack configuration is compatible with the new version.

### Example Command

Here is an example command to update `webpack` using npm:
